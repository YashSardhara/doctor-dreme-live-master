    <h2 class="featured-collections--heading heading_text" data-item="section-heading">CARE INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
  </span>
  <ol>
    <li>Take good care of your mattress.</li>
    <li>Turn your mattress from head to foot once a month for even usage and to avoid permanent body impressions.</li>
    <li>Do not bend, fold, or roll the mattress to avoid weakening the bonding and sagging.</li>
    <li>Sitting on the mattress or keeping heavy objects on its edges may ruin its shape.</li>
    <li>Avoid getting your mattress wet. Allow it to dry if it gets wet, but stain marks on the fabric will be permanent.</li>
    <li>We strongly advise a wet protective sheet when you use the mattress with children.</li>
    <li>Do not light a match or smoke near the mattress because the mattress material is flammable.</li>
    <li>Only place the mattress on a flat and firm surface.</li>
    <li>Do not pull the loose threads. Cut them with scissors.</li>
    <li>Do not remove the brand label for warranty purposes.</li>
    <li>It is normal for the mattress to smell after PVC removal. The smell goes away with proper ventilation.</li>
    <li>Do not jump or walk on the mattress.</li>
    <li>The tolerance on length or width is +/-12 mm.</li>
    <li>Flip reversible mattresses from top to bottom regularly.</li>
    <li>The mattress must fit the length and width of the bed. Improper installation may cause damage.</li>
    <li>Do not iron clothes on the mattress.</li>
  </ol>
  <span>
    <p class="common_heading warranty_registration_note">NOTE:&nbsp; </p> When the mattress conforms to your body shape, you may notice a slight mattress depression; this is called "Body Impression Marks," and it does not affect your comfort levels.</span>
