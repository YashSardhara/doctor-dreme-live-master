                                      the slatted frame, boxspring bed or directly on the floor it doesnâ€™t make any difference. It is
                                      only
                                      important to keep the surface clean and dry.

                                      down. Even turning the mattress is not necessary but possible, since the comfort zone on the
                                      mattress is symmetrical. Even without turning, Doctor Dreams Mattress is especially durable.
