              <h5>Educational Products</h5>
              <b>Learning made fun for all with Nilkamal Educational products</b>
              <p>Right to Education is a basic right that every child in the nation must have access to. A child spends an average 6 hours in schools, thus the school environment is very crucial to their overall development. With 70% of the Indian Population hailing from the rural areas, access to quality education is still limited.</p>
              <p>Health and wellbeing of students is as important as the curriculum. Lack of proper seating can lead to muscle pain neck and lower back strain. Poor posture can also lead to long-term issues, such as abnormal bone growth, which is hard to correct over time. This often leads to lack of concentration and learning issues in the long run.</p>
              <p>Comfortable seating and facility of safe storage is equally important for teachers and care-takers at schools so they are able to deliver the noble profession with complete focus.</p>
