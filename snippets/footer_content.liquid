<h3>Mattress Buying Guide</h3>
<p>Buying a <b>mattress</b> is as important as buying ingredients for a healthy diet, if not more. A <b>mattress</b> should help align your back with the rest of your body and keep your body weight well distributed. If you are still wondering how to choose the right mattress, follow this <b>mattress buying guide</b> before buying your next Nilkamal <b>mattress online</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Dimensions:</b> A <b>mattress</b> can only be used to its full potential when it perfectly fits the bed frame. Thus, while buying a mattress you should be sure of the dimensions of your bed. This will avoid any spillover from the sides or uncomfortable gaps between the <b>mattress</b> and the bed frame. For this purpose, two of the most standard dimensions for double beds include <b>king size mattress</b> and <b>queen size mattress</b> options.</li>
  <li><b>Thickness:</b> <b>Nilkamal mattresses</b> come in varying thicknesses - 4-inch, 5-inch, 5.5-inch, 6-inch, and 8-inch. You can choose the right thickness depending on the height of your bed frame and the size of your bedroom. Smaller rooms seemingly look wider with lower heights.</li>
  <li><b>Softness and Health Benefits:</b> Softness and health benefits are some of the most important factors to be considered when buying a new <b>mattress</b>. You should take into consideration any back or posture issues that are preventing you from getting a good night’s sleep and how your mattress can help with that. If your bed is directly in front of your wardrobe, choose a height and softness that allows you to sit and look into the <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/wardrobes"><b><u>wardrobe</u></b></a>, saving space and maximising comfort for that short time.</li>
  <li><b>Colour:</b> Choosing the right colour is also important if you are concerned about the cleanliness of the <b>mattress</b>. Since any stains will be more visible on lighter-coloured <b>mattresses</b>, it is not advisable for families with small kids. Some mattresses also come in pleasant designs and colours and you may want to leave them exposed. In such cases, match the colour and design with your other furniture, such as your <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/computer-tables"><b><u>computer table</u></b></a> or almirah and choose the right one.</li>
  <li><b>Price:</b> It is necessary for you to determine your budget before <b>online mattress shopping</b>. This way you can stay within your budget by considering the <b>mattress cost</b> against your determined budget. However, it should not lead to any compromise on quality and comfort.</li>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
  <p><b>1. Which is better - memory foam or spring <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattress</span>?</b></p>
<p>A <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>memory foam mattress</b></span> is more sturdy and dense and it also takes on the shape of your spine. While spring <span style="color:#3acc92;"><b>mattresses</b></span> also provide support, the springs may start losing their shape over time, making them less durable. Thus, for the long-term, a <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>memory foam mattress</b></span> is the better option.</p>
  <p><b>2. What are the different sizes of <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattresses</span>?</b></p>
<p>Generally, <span style="color:#3acc92;"><b>mattresses</b></span> come in the King, Queen, Twin and Full sizes. However, on the Nilkamal website, you will find a huge variety of dimensions suited to your needs ensuring a perfect fit.</p>
  <p><b>3. What are the materials used for making <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattresses</span>?</b></p>
<p><span style="color:#3acc92;"><b>Mattresses</b></span> are generally made using coir, foam or springs. Apart from this, materials like cotton, latex, polyurethane, EPE, and PU foam are also used.</p>
  <p><b>4. Which type of <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattress</span> is best?</b></p>
<p>The <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>best mattress</b></span> is one that suits your needs. There is no universally acknowledged <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>best mattress</b></span>. If you want a hard and flat surface, go for a <span style="color:#195bcd;"><b>coir mattress</b></span>; if you share the bed with someone but want uninterrupted sleep, then go for a <span style="color:#195bcd;"><b>spring mattress</b></span>. However, if you have back pain and spine alignment issues, a <span style="color:#195bcd;"><b>foam mattress</b></span> is your best choice.</p>
  <p><b>5. How do I pick the right <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattress</span>?</b></p>
<p>Use the <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>mattress buying guide</b></span> provided above to choose the right one for you. Consider factors such as the material, price, durability, softness, colour, and dimensions when buying.</p>
  <p><b>6. What kind of <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattress</span> is good for lower back pain?</b></p>
<p>A specially designed <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>orthopaedic memory foam mattress</b></span> is the <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>best mattress for back pain</b></span>. This is since it takes on the shape of your back, providing you with flexible support.</p>
  <p><b>7. Are pillow top <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattresses</span> bad for your back?</b></p>
<p>Pillow top <span style="color:#3acc92;"><b>mattresses</b></span> are specially designed to give soft support for your back. While they are good for your back in themselves, a pillow top <span style="color:#3acc92;"><b>mattress</b></span> with memory foam is even better.</p>

  <p>Are you planning to redesign your existing home, or setting up a new one? <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><b>Home furniture</b></span> plays a crucial role in deciding the theme and aesthetics of the surroundings. Usually, homemakers look for <span style="color: #f0c336;"><b>furniture price</b></span> and <span style="color: #6a52a8;"><b>designs</b></span> as the two main factors while buying furniture, but various essential shopping basics are equally important. Furniture brings life to your homely spaces; therefore, apart from the looks, you should closely consider other unique details and quality of the <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><b>home furniture</b></span>.</p>

  <h3>Tips and Tricks to Choose the <span style="color:#76a5af;">Best Home Furniture</span></h3>
  <p>Choosing <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><b>home furniture</b></span> seems to be a simple task for some, while some find it hard to find the ideal furniture set that complements their home decor. Therefore, you should consider the following factors before purchasing furniture.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Theme:</b> Before you look for your <b>home furniture</b>, you should decide on an appropriate theme. Rather than looking for individual pieces for each room, you can decide on a comprehensive look that goes well with the vibe of your home and decide on whether you want to go for traditional or <b>modern furniture design</b> options.</li>
    <li><b>Size:</b> You may get a massive piece of <b>home furniture</b>, but it may not go well with the size of the room, making it look overbearing and congested. A piece of suitable furniture should look good with your home decor and leave some space for free movement.</li>
  	<li><b>Colour:</b> You should closely consider the tone and decoration of your room and choose an appropriate furniture colour. No matter if the furniture is of high-end quality, if the colour does not match your home's decoration, it can look unattractive.</li>
    <li><b>Durability:</b> Furniture is a long-term investment; therefore, it should be durable. <span style="color: #4a8491;"><b>Nilkamal home furniture</b></span> offers you durable and long-lasting pieces that come with superior designs, which add a supreme touch to your space.</li>
    <li><b>Price:</b> Buying furniture can be heavy on your pockets, especially when you are setting up a new house and have to invest in <b>home furniture</b> for the entire house. So, plan your budget and choose furniture accordingly.</li>
  	<li><b>Features:</b> An ideal furniture piece should have a functional feature that can fulfil the user's requirement. It includes the height, size, and compatibility. If you are clear about the utility factor, you can look for specific features and shop accordingly instead of buying something that does not fit the bill.</li>
    <li><b>Comfort:</b> Another crucial part of a piece of furniture is its ability to provide comfort to the users. It is not worth it if a furniture piece looks beautiful but is uncomfortable. An ergonomic <b>home furniture design</b> is worth every penny.</li>

  <h3>Make your Office a Welcome Space with Nilkamal Office Furniture</h3>
  <p>Modern office spaces should not only have comfortable and elegant workstations but also designated break and waiting areas. Let’s look at a few aspects of modern day office furnishing.</p>
    <p><b>Space Management:</b> The right kind of furniture can make your office space seemingly larger. Multi-functional furniture or <b>modular office furniture</b> can save a lot of space and money for you. A work desk that can double up as a file cabinet, or chair attached with a writing flap are designs that you can incorporate into your office space. If you believe in a more flexible and fluid environment at your workplace, you can use a lot of <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/office-sofas"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>office sofas</u></b></span></a> or movable chairs that can be arranged and used as per requirements.</p>
  <p><b>Employee Wellness:</b> Employees spend long working hours seated at one place. It is common knowledge that modern professionals develop neck and back-related problems due to incorrect sitting postures. These become chronic health issues over prolonged periods. Suitable <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><b>office furniture</b></span> should be chosen keeping employee wellness in mind.</p>
    <p><b>Improved Productivity:</b> You need to rethink your office decor if your employees are taking too many days off mainly due to falling sick or simply not wanting to be there. Uncomfortable seating or isolation due to office design directly hampers their productivity and in turn overall company performance. <b>Home office furniture</b>, such as comfortable <b>executive chairs</b>, is a modern day requirement that many are facing for the first time. </p>
  <p><b>Encourage Collaboration:</b> It’s been proven that when coworkers share best practices, overall productivity goes up and the work environment improves. Office desk sharing can be a great way of increasing productive interaction between employees. The right <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><b>office furniture</b></span> can create a sense of comradery among piers.</p>
  <p><b>Brand Credibility:</b> There are brands like Google or Oracle, which are famous for creating incredible seating, resting, and waiting areas with latest <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><b>office furniture</b></span> designs that inspire and motivate new ideas and employee performance. This adds to the market credibility of the brand you are associated with.</p>

  <h3>Things to consider while buying a bed</h3>
  <p>The furniture in your house reflects your personality. Sometimes you get carried away while looking at different options of beds. Beds can provide you with an excellent option to flex your creative muscles, and you can experiment with multiple colours and designs. However, you need to consider your preferences, needs, and budget while selecting <span style="color: #10b050;"><b>bed design for bedrooms</b></span>. Here are few insights as to how you can choose the perfect bed for your bedroom.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Spatial area of the bedroom</b>: Before buying a bed, know the dimensions of your bedroom. Consider the dimensions of other furniture pieces you want in your room, such as <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/dressing-tables"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>dressing table</u></b></span></a>, <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/bedside-tables"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>bedside table</u></b></span></a>, <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/study-tables"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><u>study table</u></span></a>, <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/wardrobes"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><u>wardrobe</u></span></a>, or any other item. Depending upon the space available in your bedroom, you will be able to determine the dimensions of the bed you need.</li>
    <li><b>Bed size</b>: Choose a bed size that is comfortable enough for you when you sleep. A small bed can keep your feet dangling, which is not ideal. Also, check out the shape of the beds; if you have space constraints in your kid’s room, go for a <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>bunker bed</b></span> or <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>double-decker bed</b></span> instead of a regular <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>double bed design</b></span>.</li>
    <li><b>Colour theme and material</b>: A bed is a long term investment, so always choose a sturdy and durable material. If you choose a <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>wooden double bed with storage</b></span>, make sure it has good moisture resistance. A steel bed must be rust-resistant. It is also essential to maintain a colour theme in the room. The design pattern should be in sync with the wallpapers and other furniture.</li>
    <li><b>Storage or non-storage bed</b>: If you have a small house without much space in the wardrobes, having a bed with storage can solve your problem. You can use the storage space to keep clothes, beddings, and much more. Some beds also have drawers that are easily accessible. You can also consider a <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>hydraulic queen size bed</b></span> or a <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>hydraulic bed king size</b></span> that does not have drawers, but you can store gazillion items. The storage space depends on the size of the bed. A <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>king-size bed with storage</b></span> can help you store many different things in one place.</li>
    <li><b>Budget</b>: You don’t have to burn a hole in your pocket for buying a <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>modern single bed</b></span> or double bed. You can easily filter out the beds which are within your range. Moreover, beds available on Nilkamal are affordable and provide a good return on your investment due to the high-quality craftsmanship.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Depending on these above-mentioned factors, you can easily select bed frames that meet all your needs. With options for storage beds, such as <b>single bed design with storage</b> and <b>modern bed design with storage</b>, you can easily maximise space even in a small room. Additionally, you can use <b>king size bed design with storage</b> to act as a storage for all your winter bedding in the summers. Even without storage options, get excellent <b>king size cot designs</b> and many more at Nilkamal.</p>

This helps to improve their sitting posture and concentration. Go for designs that have built-in storage like drawers, cubbyholes, hinged cupboards, and pen stands. Lastly, get a suitable chair. A complementing chair can make the space look aesthetically appealing, and it will save time and effort in adjusting the incline of the table.</p>

    <li><b>What should I look for at a dressing table?</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Other than built-in storage options, always take into consideration the size of your bedroom. Make sure the dressing table is proportionate to the room and is in sync with the rest of the furniture.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Does a coffee table always need to be centred?</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>A nice coffee table placed centrally within your living room creates a welcoming ambience. However, if you have a large or a very long living room, you can consider having two centre tables. One can be larger than the other.</p>

  <h3>How to choose the right dining table for your home</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Use your measuring tape</b>: Your dining table set has to fit your dining area. Since a dining table is deceptively large, so you need to account for space around it too. In addition to the space occupied by the table, you need at least three feet of space on all sides to sit on the <b>dining table chair</b> comfortably.</li>
    <li><b>Before settling on shapes, consider your needs</b>: Square and rectangular tables are the most commonly bought. Round or oval tables are deemed great for parties and conversations as there is no head of the table. But in terms of adding more seating, you are only limited as per the table's perimeter since these shapes are non-extendable.</li>
    <li><b>Pay attention to the table support</b>: There are three common types of the table base, legs, pedestal and trestle. The table base can affect the count of people you can fit at a table. A table with thin legs or where the legs are at the corner will make it easier to squeeze an extra chair. Just be sure the support system does not invade the leg space.</li>
    <li><b>Choose the right material</b>: For choosing the right material for a dining set, you need to balance factors like price, personal style and ease of care. The most common materials are wood, mild steel, plastic and leatherette.</li>

  <h3>FAQs</h3>
  <p><b>1. Which dining table shape is best for small rooms?</b></p>
  <p>The square and round shapes of dining tables are considered perfect for small rooms.</p>
  <p><b>2. What is better, wood or glass top?</b></p>
  <p>If we talk about aesthetics and beauty, <b>glass top dining tables</b> always look premium and attractive. But in terms of durability, especially if there is a rough use, a wooden tabletop should be preferred.</p>
  <p><b>3. What is better, a dining chair or dining bench?</b></p>
  <p>Dining benches provide more seating space than chairs, and they are comparatively cheaper if you consider per-seat cost. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/dining-chairs"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><u>dining chairs</u></span></a> give you the flexibility of free movement, and you can also stack them if you wish to stow them away. So it depends on your usage and requirements.</p>
  <p><b>4. Should the length of the dining bench match the length of the table?</b></p>
  <p>The length of the dining bench should be equal to the length of the dining table or slightly shorter.</p>
  <p><b>5. Which type of dining table is best?</b></p>
  <p>Rectangular and square tables are the most common, so you will find more styles, design patterns, and size options in these shapes. Round and oval tables give you a little extra space to move around since it cuts off the corners. Depending on the size of your room and area requirements, you can make the selection.</p>

  <h3>Tips for choosing kids furniture</h3>
  <p>Whether moving into a new house or renovating an existing kids bedroom, you must consider certain aspects. The first is that kids furniture doesn’t need to be that lavish; it should be safe, accessible and meet their needs. From cot like beds to chairs shaped like crowns, quirky furniture pieces have a psychological impact on their minds, and they start feeling that their bedroom is their safety zone. Make sure that your child participates in choosing designs in patterns of the furniture, especially when transitioning from a crib to a big bed for a toddler. And the good part is you don’t have to wage war with your bank balance to have a decked-up kids bedroom. All you need is some primary kids furniture items and a creative eye. So let’s begin!</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Choose a theme</b>: Your kid's bedroom theme can be as simple as their favourite colour or a specific cartoon character like Mickey Mouse, Doraemon, Chhota Bheem or a superhero like Spiderman, batman etc. You can also go for elaborate themes like the animal kingdom, ocean life, stars and planets and so on. You can narrow down your furniture choices according to the theme chosen.</li>
    <li><b>Accessorise furniture to tie together your theme</b>: You don’t have to get everything customised accordingly. Suppose you choose a simple dressing table. You can replace the simple knobs with football-shaped knobs or heart-shaped knobs. If you already have a study table, just replace the chair as per the theme and add colourful cushions. Buy a basic kids bed and add a light canopy for a princess theme or galaxy theme bedroom. You can use a heavier mosquito net for a jungle-theme room.</li>
    <li><b>Mix colours for a vibrant palette</b>: Choose colourful furniture and other furnishing items; kids will love to see them all nicely placed in their room—for example, storage shelves, wardrobes, drawers, chairs, bins etc. If you are decorating the room based on your child's favourite colour, then look for a few pieces in a contrasting colour to add a fun element.</li>
    <li><b>Use playful accent pieces to decorate on a budget</b>: If your budget doesn’t allow for replacements after a couple of years, don’t go for oversized age-specific furniture items. Stick to classic pieces for the bed, wardrobe and dressing table. But you can use bright colours and themes in other small things, like a <b>small kid's chairs</b> like kids rocking chairs or a <b>kids desk chair</b>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>3. How to keep kids room furniture clean?</b></p>
  <p>Kids can create a mess at times, and there isn’t much you can do about it other than teaching them about the importance of hygiene and cleanliness. But it is essential to see that their furniture and belongings are well maintained. Regular dusting is necessary. Use a vacuum and a wet wiping cloth for food stains. Some stains are tough to remove, such as colours or ink stains. For those cases, you can use a baking soda paste and rub it to get rid of it. The baking soda technique works well on wood, MDF and plastics.</p>

  <h3>Plan it Well With <span style="color: #45818e;">Nilkamal Sofas</span></h3>
  <p>Though we often look at the colour scheme of our furniture first, there are other important aspects to consider before buying a <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>modern sofa set</b></span>. Below are a few points to keep in mind when you decide to <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>buy sofa sets online</b></span>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Size:</b> An oversized <b>sofa set</b> or <b>recliner</b> can quickly become a burden you can’t get rid of. Or a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sectional-sofas"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>2-seater sofa</u></b></span></a> in a large hall can make it look incomplete. Knowing the space you want to decorate and choosing the correct dimensions for your <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>sofa</b></span> is essential for it to serve the purpose.</li>
    <li><b>Utility:</b> If you entertain large groups of guests at your home, a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sectional-sofas"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>sectional sofa</u></b></span></a> or <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>sofa set</b></span> will be a prudent buy than a <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>recliner</b></span> or a <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>one-seater sofa</b></span>. You won’t like it if you find your guests looking for a place to sit and not finding one. Similarly, a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sofa-cum-beds"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>sofa come bed</u></b></span></a> comes in handy when you have overnight guests or frequent sleepovers for your kids. Also, putting a <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>garden sofa</b></span> in your living room can be a design mismatch.</li>
    <li><b>Decor:</b> Though it’s not always necessary to have a pre-decided colour or design theme in mind before buying a <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>sofa</b></span> or <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>sofa set</b></span>, but knowing what you want helps in bringing some homogeneity to your decor. It’s good to have an idea whether you want a wooden or a PVC frame, or what kind of upholstery material you want.</li>
    <li><b>Budget:</b> If you have a pre-decided budget in mind, you can filter out <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>sofas</b></span> which are within your range. You can look for discounts and deals on the Nilkamal website where you can get deals with more than 50% discount.</li>
    <li><b>Durability:</b> It is important to check the quality of the frame and foam or cushions before narrowing down your search for a <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>sofa</b></span>. These are not articles that you can replace monthly or yearly. People tend to invest a huge amount on <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>sofa sets</b></span> or <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sectional-sofas"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>sectional sofas</u></b></span></a> to buy good quality furniture to ensure their longevity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>1. What’s the difference between a <span style="color: #72ad59;">sofa</span> and a couch?</b></p>

You can also choose a <span style="color: #467fda;"><b>garden sofa</b></span> for seating arrangement outdoors.</p>
  <p><b>3. Which sofa is best for the living room?</b></p>
  <p>It all depends on the kind of space you have in your living room. You can choose a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sectional-sofas"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>sectional sofa</u></b></span></a> if you need to add dimension to a huge hall and create smaller sections.

  <p><b>4. How do I choose a sofa for my living room?</b></p>
  <p>Measure your living room space and check the dimensions you can accommodate. An oversized or underwhelming <span style="color: #72ad59;"><b>sofa</b></span> or <span style="color: #467fda;"><b>recliner</b></span> won’t serve the purpose of an efficient and stylish living space.</p>
  <p><b>5. What colour of <span style="color: #72ad59;">sofa</span> is best?</b></p>
  <p>You should go for a colour that suits the interiors and wall paint of the room you want to decorate. Usually light colours go well with dark furniture. If the rest of your furniture is of muted colour, you might want to add a dash of colour by going for dark brown or blue <span style="color: #72ad59;"><b>sofa</b></span>.</p>
  <p><b>6. How do you maintain a fabric <span style="color: #72ad59;">sofa</span>?</b></p>
  <p>You can use a vacuum machine for your <span style="color: #72ad59;"><b>sofa</b></span> fabric for deep cleaning. Avoid any direct sun exposure and use a dry clean cloth for regular cleaning.</p>
  <p><b>7. What should I know before buying a <span style="color: #72ad59;">sofa</span>?</b></p>

    <h3>Things to consider while buying an entertainment unit</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Measure your TV:</b> This is the most crucial factor to consider. You should not match the screen size of the television with the size of the entertainment unit; you must know the frame size, the total height and width of the TV. Also, consider how deep the unit is so that it fits securely. There should be a gap of 2 inches around the TV to get the space for cables, and the equipment can have good ventilation around.</li>
      <li><b>Measure your room:</b> Choose the size of the entertainment unit according to your room size and the viewing distance. Usually, if you want an entertainment unit for your bedroom, it is better to go for a compact TV cabinet or LCD unit. Wall units are pretty big, and they look good in the living room or hall.</li>
      <li><b>Entertainment unit placement:</b> Firstly, consider how your room is laid out to place the entertainment unit and the television. The tv screen should be at a comfortable level with your line of sight when you are seated. Depending on the seating arrangement, the TV size, and the viewing height, you can decide whether to go for a high TV unit or a low TV unit.  Also, the availability of power outlets and cable lines is essential while determining where to put them. Always keep your entertainment unit away from the windows so that backlighting doesn’t spoil your view. </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Factors to consider while picking up 3 seater sofa</h3>
  <p>Buying a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/3-seater-sofas"><span style="color: #72ad59;"><b><u>three seater sofa</u></b></span></a> is one of the most crucial investments you make for your home because they are expensive and they need to last for a longer duration. In the living room where we spend most of our time, this is the piece of furniture where we read, eat, drink, lounge, watch TV and even sleep, so it is important to consider various factors while selecting a sofa. You can experiment with multiple colours and designs as a sofa can provide you with an excellent option to flex your creative muscles. Here are the four important things you should consider if you are planning to buy a new sofa.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="color: #72ad59;"><b>3 seater sofa</b></span> <b>dimensions</b>: Size and shape are the major consideration when buying a three-seater sofa as it needs to fit perfectly in your space. Usually, <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/3-seater-sofas"><span style="color: #72ad59;"><b>3 Seater sofa size</b></span></a> varies between 60-84 inches in width. Always measure your place with tape before purchasing a sofa to check out the maximum <span style="color: #72ad59;"><b>3 seater sofa dimensions</b></span> that can fit well in your space. Secondly, pay attention to the height of the sofa, especially if your room has shelving or radiators. Thirdly check if still ample space is left to walk around it with ease as some <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/3-seater-sofas"><span style="color: #72ad59;"><b>sofa 3 seater design</b></span></a> options are more spacious than they seem.</li>
    <li><b>Colour scheme</b>: Make sure the sofa you select goes well with the overall décor theme and serve the purpose. Always choose the colours and designs that coordinate well with tables and wallpapers for a cohesive decor. Even the design pattern should be in sync with the wallpapers and other furniture. It is safer to go for neutral shades sofa, as it goes well with most indoor spaces. But you can also experiment with bright and quirky sofas in your drawing-room. A <span style="color: #72ad59;"><b>3 seater couch</b></span> is a statement piece, and adding colours and patterns makes it more exciting.</li>
    <li><b>Invest in a good frame</b>: A solid and durable frame is essential for a good three-seater sofa. Hardwood frames are always a good option and avoid particle board or metal construction. Also, look for sofas that have a manufacturer warranty. So, regardless of whether you buy a <span style="color: #72ad59;"><b>3 seater wooden sofa</b></span> or <span style="color: #72ad59;"><b>3 seater fabric sofa</b></span>, Nilkamal furniture provides a good return on investment due to the high-quality material and skilled craftsmanship.</li>
    <li><b>Focus on the fabric</b>: Consider your usage and lifestyle while deciding on a sofa fabric. Sensuous and glossy fabrics like silk, velvet, brocade are perfect for sophisticated spaces like drawing rooms or hotel receptions. Whereas easy to clean fabrics, PVC or stained guarded twill are ideal for kids and living rooms.</li>

Three-seater recliner sofas are adjustable, and some are equipped with the feature of setting up the reclining angle.

  <h3>Recliner sofa three seater buying guide</h3>
  <p>A three-seater recliner sofa is a comfortable and space-efficient furniture piece that creates a premium environment in the room. It provides plenty of seating space to a family, and everyone gets a seat along with full comfort. Finding the perfect recliner sofa is also a big task and one of the most crucial investments you make for your home because they are expensive and need to last long. You need to check if it suits your body comfort requirements. A wrong choice can introduce multiple health issues like bad posture, back pain etc. You can experiment with multiple designs. Here are the four important things you should consider if you plan to buy a <b>three seater recliner sofa</b>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Measure up the available space</b>: A three-seater recliner sofa provides comfort that is similar to the bed. You need to be considerate of the space needed so that you can relax easily on your reclining couch. The way a recliner utilizes minimum space to provide maximum comfort is absolutely remarkable. Before you start searching for a recliner sofa, measure up the space you have in your room. Keep in mind the space required for placement and opening up the recliner. You should never place the recliner sofa against a wall. This implies that you must do the whole planning according to the placement of the TV and other furniture items.</li>
    <li><b>Select colours and designs according to your decor</b>: It is important to choose the recliner sofa that goes well with the theme of your home. You can place a <b>recliner sofa three seater</b> options in a living room, drawing room, bedroom and office space. For a study room or office cabin, you can pick an ergonomically designed recliner that can help to improve your sitting posture and provide you additional comfort. Select an eye-catching design that blends well with the existing decor of the living room or drawing-room. </li>
    <li><b>Resistant frame and good craftsmanship</b>: Now that you know the available space and the size you need, start looking for options with a sturdy frame and internal structure. A frame of the furniture plays a vital role in deciding strength and longevity. Hardwood frame is always a good option. Make sure the structure is strong enough to adapt to various reclining angles, and the quality of the materials used is good so that it can easily bear weight and minor impacts. Also, look for recliner sofas that have a manufacturer warranty. <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/3-seater-recliners"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><u>Nilkamal’s</u></span></a> furniture provides a good return on investment due to the high-quality material and skilled craftsmanship.</li>
    <li><b>Focus on the fabric and the features</b>: Different recliner sofas come with different functionalities and features. You need to check if the sofa you are choosing can fulfil your requirements. For instance, it could be a specific reclining angle, glass holder, or a hollow space to keep a book. You can explore different kinds of <span style="color: #06b254;"><b>3 seater fabric recliner sofa</b></span> to see which one supports your body and back the best and which material feels the most relaxing to lie on. Consider your usage and lifestyle while deciding on a sofa fabric. Sensuous and glossy fabrics like silk, velvet, brocade are perfect for sophisticated spaces like drawing rooms. Whereas easy to clean fabrics, PVC or stain guarded twill are ideal for living rooms and the workplace. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How to arrange the reclining furniture</h3>

    <h3>How to choose the right side tables for bedroom decor?</h3>
    <p>While designing a bedroom interior, once you are done with the double bed and wardrobe, now is the time to select the right bedside tables. Choosing a side table is a bit like choosing a dessert for your meal. It should blend in well with your bed, completing its style while serving its function. Besides the bed, it should also work in harmony with the decoration, lighting and other pieces of furniture in the bedroom. As discussed, a bedside table enhances the beauty of your bedroom, so there are numerous factors that you should take into account while purchasing a bedside table. Here we go :</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Know the right height and the size:</b> It is always better to add two bedside tables to create a beautiful symmetry. In case you have a compact bedroom, then you can add one side table. Measure up the length of the space adjacent to the bed to determine the length of the side tables. It should not be higher than the top of the mattress. Creating a clean straight line from bed to side table will make it convenient to reach for something during nighttime. The difference of up to 2 inches of height is still fine. In this regard, you should also consider the height of your <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/mattress"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><b><u>mattress</u></b></span></a> and whether it matches it.</li>
      <li><b>Ensure there is enough space:</b> Another practical aspect of a side table other than aesthetics is the storage. Before you get distracted by colours and textures, it is a good idea to consider the surface space. That is the place where you are likely to put essential nighttime items. You can also use that space to display decorative items or a large bedside lamp as well. Secondly, consider the things that you want to store inside the table. If you need a home for undergarments, accessories, or other small items like medicines or cosmetics, a <b>bedside table with drawers for bedroom</b> decor is the perfect option.</li>
      <li><b>Try out contrasting colours:</b> Choosing the side table with the same colour as the walls will mute your furniture. Try adding a pop of colour to your bedroom. Look for shades that accentuate your space rather than blending into them. Usually, colours that are a few tones darker or lighter than your wall colour will make it an eye-catching addition.</li>
      <li><b>Choose the right material:</b> For choosing the right material, you need to balance factors like price, your style and ease of care. The most common materials are wood, mild steel, glass and plastic.</li>
    </ul>
