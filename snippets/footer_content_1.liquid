    <h3>What should I look for while purchasing a coffee table?</h3>
    <p>As discussed, a coffee table enhances the beauty of your living room, so there are numerous factors that you should take into account while purchasing a coffee table. Here we go: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Check the size:</b> Measure up your living room space between the sofas to determine the size of the coffee table required. The centre table should not be lower than 3-4 inches from the seat of your sofa. The standard height of the centre table is usually between 15-20 inches. </li>
        <li><b>Select the shape:</b> Square and rectangular tables are the most commonly bought as they are extendable; you can join two or three tables together if you have guests. Round or oval tables are ideal if you have kids as they don't have edgy corners and gives a little more space to walk around.</li>
        <li><b>Functionality:</b> Consider the usage of the coffee table. Do you want it to be decorative, or do you need storage space as well? We have centre tables with shelves and drawers to keep your snacks, cutlery, books and other valuable items.</li>
        <li><b>Choose the suitable material:</b> To choose the right material for a coffee table, you need to balance factors like price, style, and ease of care. The most common materials are wood, mild steel, glass and plastic.</li>
    </ul>

Here are some of the benefits of adding a dining bench to your home.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>More seating capacity:</b> Dining benches are perfect for large gatherings whenever additional seating is required. A bench can accommodate more people as compared to a chair that is limited to one per person. You can increase the seating capacity while minimising the number of furniture in the room. Moreover, if you love entertaining and hosting guests, you need a dining bench for your living room. </li>
      <li><b>Better interaction:</b> A perfect seating option for socialising aspect. While sitting on a bench, people sit closely and feel more connected to each other. It is strongly believed that sitting on a bench promotes intimacy and interaction.</li>
      <li><b>Storage space:</b> Some dining benches are designed with storage space. They are equipped with pull-out shelves or lift-up seats. If you need a functional piece of furniture that provides both seating space and storage, then go for it.</li>
      <li><b>Versatile:</b> The dining bench is quite versatile and can be used in any setup. Besides the dining room, you can place a then in the kitchen, balcony, terrace or garden.</li>
      <li><b>Space-saving:</b> When the dining table is not in use, you can push the dining bench entirely under the table to increase the living room‚Äôs free space. This will make your dining room look neater and less cluttered.</li>
      <li><b>Design feature:</b> A dining bench seat, if upholstered nicely, can also amp up the room‚Äôs overall d√©cor. So always choose the fabrics that look premium and stylish.</li>
      <li><b>Does not block the view:</b> If your dining table is arranged along a window that projects a beautiful outside view, then having a dining bench can keep your view unobstructed.</li>
      <li><b>Cost-effective:</b> If you compare the per-seat cost price, a dining bench is always less expensive than chairs or sofas. And you are getting seating capacity, versatility and storage in a single item.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to select the perfect dining bench for your dining table</h3>
    <p>The dining table and dining bench are the focal points of the living room or dining room. You must choose the right furniture according to the overall ambience of the room. Here are some essential factors to consider while choosing the dining bench.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Measure up your space and the dining table:</b> The length of the dining bench should be equal to or a bit lesser than the length of the dining table since only then will you be able to tuck the bench under the table. If you are planning to position your bench against the wall, make sure to measure the backrest height to check if it fits any radiators, panelling or windowsills.</li>
      <li><b>Backrest or backless:</b> A dining bench with a backrest offers more support as you can lean back comfortably while sitting. They also create a better visual impact on the room decor if you want to add a style element. It also allows you to squeeze more people even if the sitting becomes a snugger. Backless dining benches are suitable for compact dining rooms as they can be tucked under the table when not in use.</li>
      <li><b>Dining bench colour and pattern:</b> Most people choose a dining bench that harmonises with the design of the dining table. Sometimes the intentional mismatches also look attractive. So you can use your creativity to create something exceptional.</li>
      <li><b>Extendable seats:</b> Certain dining benches can be joined end to end to extend the seating space. If you need that kind of seating arrangement, then choose benches with extendable seats.</li>

    <h3>Choosing the perfect dining chairs for your dining table</h3>
    <p>The dining table and dining chairs are the statement pieces of the living room or dining room. You must choose the ideal chairs according to the overall ambience of the room. Here are some essential factors to consider while choosing dining chairs.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Chair height:</b> The overall dimensions of the dining chairs should be compatible with the dining table. The difference between the height of the top of the dining chair and the tabletop should be between 8-12 inches. So measure the table height and choose the chairs accordingly. Remember that the upholstered chairs compress slightly when you sit on them, so consider it while making your final decision.</li>
      <li><b>Chair width and depth:</b> Chairs are usually pushed under the table when the dining table is not in use. The width and depth of the chair determine if the chair can completely fit under the table or not.</li>
      <li><b>Armed or unarmed:</b> Armed chairs are more comfortable, but you can‚Äôt fit them under the table. Unarmed chairs save space in the room when the table is not in use.</li>
      <li><b>Back height:</b> Choose dining chairs with a back that extends at least 2-3 inches above the table height. Chairs designed with a very low back compared to the table height look odd and can be harmful to your back.</li>
      <li><b>Chair colour and pattern:</b> Most people choose dining chairs that match well with the designs of your dining table. Sometimes the intentional mismatches also look attractive. So you can use your creativity to create something exceptional.</li>
      <li><b>Spacing dining chairs:</b> When you arrange dining chairs around the dining table, they must have at least 20 inches of space between them measured from the seat‚Äôs centre. The spacing is required for enough elbow room. If your table is large, then you can be more generous with the spacing.</li>
      <li><b>Extra dining chairs:</b> If you have extra dining chairs, you can use them with small <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/coffee-tables"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><u>coffee tables</u></span></a> to increase the seating space.</li>

    <h3>Reasons why you should invest in a premium dining table</h3>
    <p>Dining table sets are multifunctional; it is the place where the family can have meals together, a place where kids can do their homework or some craft activities, and a place where the whole family can have a round table conference. Here are some significant benefits of adding a dining set to your home.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Impression on guests:</b> A dining set showcases your style of living and leaves an everlasting impression on your guests. Dining sets are primarily placed in a dining or a living room, where you can warmly welcome your guests and get involved in productive conversations. So invest in a premium quality <b>dining table set</b> that can enhance the overall look of your dining room.</li>
      <li><b>Better relations among family members:</b> In today's world, everyone has a busy routine, and people hardly get time to stay connected with their family members. By eating together at a dining table, you can maintain eye contact and develop better communication with your family.</li>
      <li><b>Versatile usage and utility:</b> You can use the dining set in multiple ways while arranging a house party. You can use the dining table to cut the cake, serve food, placing cutlery or other such items. This centrepiece can do much more than adding a different style to the overall d√©cor of the home.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What should I look for while purchasing a dining set?</h3>
    <p>As discussed, a dining set is more than just a place to sit and eat. There are numerous factors that you should take into account while purchasing a dining set.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Measure your space:</b> Your dining table set has to fit your dining area. Since a dining table is deceptively large, so you need to account for space around it too. In addition to the space occupied by the table, you need at least three feet of breathing room on all sides to sit on the <b>dining table chair</b> comfortably.</li>
      <li><b>Before settling on shapes, consider your needs:</b> Square and rectangular tables are the most commonly bought. Round or oval tables are deemed great for parties and conversations as there is no head of the table. But in terms of adding more seating, you are only limited as per the table's perimeter. These shapes are non-extendable.</li>
      <li><b>Pay attention to the table support:</b> There are three common types of the table base, legs, pedestal and trestle. The table base can affect the count of people you can fit at a table. A table with thin legs or where the legs are at the corner will make it easier to squeeze an extra chair. Just be sure the support system does not invade the leg space.</li>
      <li><b>Choose the most suitable material:</b> For choosing the right material for a dining set, you need to balance factors like price, your style and ease of care. The most common materials are wood, mild steel, plastic and leatherette.</li>

    <h3>Distinct shapes of dining tables</h3>
    <p>If you are planning to revamp your dining room with a brand new dining table, then it is essential to know the various types of dining tables available in the market. You can segregate dining table designs based on the tabletop shape. There are broadly four kinds of table shapes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Square dining table:</b> Perfectly designed for a family having our members, square-shaped dining tables are suitable for small space dining rooms. It is designed for compact apartments and can be easily accommodated without consuming much space. The square dining table provides a unified space between all family members and equalises the distance. This makes the family discussions more impactful, and you can enjoy fine dining together.</li>
      <li><b>Rectangular dining table:</b> This is the most popular shape among all. If you have an extended family, then this is the right fit for your dining room. It gives enough space for a luxury dining experience. You can also extend a rectangular dining table by joining a coffee table end to end to increase the seating space.</li>
      <li><b>Round dining table:</b> If you are looking for a compact dining table for your small dining room, go for a round dining table. Just like a square dining table, round tables also create a cosy atmosphere in the dining space. It brings the family members closer together while having meals and helps them socialise after coming home from work and school.</li>
      <li><b>Oval dining table:</b> Oval dining tables are designed for large and narrow dining spaces. Similar to the rectangular dining table, the oval dining tables can also accommodate many people and guests. It also has the advantage of round edges; therefore, people can move around freely without getting hurt. It also offers more space for legroom and elevates the overall dining experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to select the perfect dining table for your dining room?</h3>
    <p>As discussed, a dining table is more than just a place to sit and eat. There are numerous factors that you should take into account while purchasing a dining table.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Measure your space:</b> Here is a pro tip. To test out the dining table size in your dining room, take a bedsheet, place it where you intend to place the table, and fold it into the shape of the table. This way, you can visualise the space it will take. Since a dining table is deceptively large, so you need to account for space around it too. In addition to the space occupied by the table, you need at least three feet of breathing room on all sides to sit on the <b>dining table chair</b> comfortably.</li>
      <li><b>Pay attention to the table support:</b> There are three common types of the table base, legs, pedestal and trestle. The table base can affect the count of people you can fit at a table. A table with thin legs or where the legs are at the corner will make it easier to squeeze an extra chair. Just be sure the support system does not invade the leg space.</li>
      <li><b>Choose the suitable material:</b> A dining table can be constructed from different variety of materials. It may have a holistic design, where different materials are used for tabletop and table frames. For choosing the suitable material for the dining table, you need to balance factors like price, your style and ease of care. The most common materials are wood, mild steel, plastic and leatherette.</li>

    <h3>How to choose the right dressing table?</h3>
    <p>When it comes to clothes, one size doesn‚Äôt fit all. The same thing goes with dressing tables. It can be tough to decide what kind of dressing table is perfect for your bedroom since there are numerous options available in the market. It should also work in harmony with the decoration, lighting and other pieces of furniture in the bedroom. Here are some factors that you should take into account while purchasing a dressing table.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Features</b>: Firstly, consider the kind of features that you need from the dresser before you buy. If your bedroom has many items, you might need a space to display, or maybe a high storage space can be your preference. Usually, you can buy a tall and narrow dresser if you have a space crunch in your bedroom. However, if you need a dressing table to fill broader space in your room, then go for short dressers. A short dresser can have wide drawers and ample space to store your essentials. Moreover, if the height of the dresser complements the bed, you can also use it as a bedside table.</li>
      <li><b>Style</b>: Choose the style that goes well with your bedroom d√©cor. Many dressing table styles are available at Nilkamal, starting from minimalistic to rustic, modern to contemporary, tall or short, simple or ornate, drawers or doors. These dressing tables can fulfil everyone‚Äôs tastes and preferences. Choosing a dressing table with the same colour as that of walls will mute your furniture. Try adding a pop of colour to your bedroom. Look for shades that accentuate your space rather than blending into them. Usually, colours that are a few tones darker or lighter than your wall colour will make it an eye-catching addition.</li>
      <li><b>Size</b>: Size is another essential aspect to consider while choosing a dressing table. Adding a bigger dressing table can block too much space in your bedroom. On the other hand, a tiny dressing table will bring no storage benefit. You need to choose according to your bedroom size and the storage requirements.</li>
      <li><b>Right material</b>: For choosing the right material, you need to balance factors like price, your style and ease of care. The most common materials are engineered wood, MDF and mild steel.</li>
      <li><b>Choose the right place within the bedroom</b>: These days, many homes are equipped with a dedicated dressing room that is usually attached to a washroom. If you don‚Äôt have a dedicated dressing room, you can place the dressing table in the bedroom. Just make sure a dressing table needs open space and sufficient natural light. If the lighting is not enough, add more lights or go for the dressing table designs with light bulbs installed.</li>
    </ul>

      <li><b>Colourful lounge chairs for every corner:</b> Fill up the nooks and corners of the home with colourful lounge chairs instead of conventional corner tables. Versatile and timeless, these chairs add a luxurious touch and make beautiful statement pieces. If you want a traditional touch, then go for premium sofa chairs.</li>
      <li><b>Colourful pillows:</b> You can decorate a basic lounge chair by adding colourful pillows. It is always better to choose a contrasting pillow and if you are using multiple pillows, make sure they match each other. Similarly, if you have a rustic home d√©cor theme, go for geometric prints or baroque prints, and if you have bright contemporary themes, try quirky bohemian prints.</li>
      <li><b>Match other furniture to your lounge chair:</b> Try adding a matching ottoman with your lounge chairs. Just turn on the TV, get your munching snack, sit on your lounge chair and imagine placing your feet on a soft and comfortable ottoman. It will give you a heaven-like comfort feeling.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>You can decorate a basic plastic chair by adding colourful pillows if the chair is armed or use a colourful cushion pillow pad if the chair is unarmed. It is always better to choose a contrasting pillow and if you are using multiple pillows, make sure they match each other. Similarly, if you have a rustic home d√©cor theme, go for geometric prints or baroque prints. If you have bright contemporary themes, then try quirky, bohemian prints.</li>
    <li>Try adding a matching ottoman with your chairs for relaxing your body after a long hectic day at work. Just turn on the TV, get your munching snack, sit on your plastic chair and imagine placing your feet on a soft and comfortable ottoman. It will give you a heaven-like comfort feeling.</li>

  <h3>Recliners online: Guide for when you need to buy recliners online</h3>
  <p>Great features, multiple functionalities and exquisite comfort are a few things you can expect from a <b>recliner chair</b> or sofa. The popularity of the recliners has been on the rise ever since they came into the picture. The <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/living-room"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><b><u>living room</u></b></span></a> is one of the most important parts of the house, and everyone wants their living room to look classy and be comfortable at the same time. Moreover, how you style your living room also reflects your personality. Considering the current trends, a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/3-seater-recliners"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><b><u>recliner sofa 3 seater</u></b></span></a> or a <b>sofa recliner 2 seater</b> is one of the best you can choose for your living room. Getting the correct <b>recliner sofa online</b> can be difficult if you are unaware of the necessary factors to consider. You need to check if it suits your body comfort requirements. A wrong choice can introduce multiple health issues like bad posture, back pain etc. here are the four important considerations if you plan to buy a recliner sofa.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Be clear about the space:</b> The way a recliner utilizes minimum space to provide maximum comfort is absolutely remarkable. Before you start searching for a recliner sofa, measure up the space you have in your room. Keep in mind the space required for placement and opening up the recliner. You must do the whole planning according to the placement of the TV and other furniture items. In this way, you can decide whether yo0u need a recliner or whether simple <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/chairs"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><b><u>chairs</u></b></span></a> would suit the space better.</li>
    <li><b>Select colours and designs according to their placement:</b> You can place a <b>recliner sofa</b> in a living room, drawing room, study room, bedroom and office space. Make sure the recliner you select goes well with the room's overall d√©cor theme and serves the purpose. For a study room or office cabin, you can pick an ergonomically designed recliner that can help to improve your sitting posture and provide you additional comfort. Select an eye-catching design that blends well with the existing decor for the living room or drawing-room. We also have foldable recliner chairs that you can easily carry from one place to other. Recliner chairs are lightweight and suitable for both indoor and outdoor seating.</li>
    <li><b>Check quality and durability:</b> When you need to <span style="color: #33b050;"><b>buy recliner chair</b></span> sets, consider it as more of an investment since it is costly. A frame of the furniture plays a vital role in deciding strength and longevity. Also, look for recliner sofas that have a manufacturer warranty. Nilkamal‚Äôs furniture provides a good return on investment due to the high-quality material and skilled craftsmanship.</li>
    <li><b>Focus on the fabric and the features:</b> Some recliners may be good aesthetically and functionally but not according to your body type. You need to check if the sofa you are choosing can fulfil your requirements. For instance, it could be a specific reclining angle, glass holder, or a hollow space to keep a book. Consider your usage and lifestyle while deciding on a sofa fabric. Sensuous and glossy fabrics like silk, velvet, brocade are perfect for sophisticated spaces like drawing rooms. Whereas easy to clean fabrics, PVC or stain guarded twill are ideal for living rooms and the workplace. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Placement ideas for reclining chairs</h3>
    <p>A recliner is not like an ordinary sofa chair - it comes with the benefit of stress reliving that is similar to a bed. You can easily lean back on a recliner to watch TV or doze off. To enjoy the benefits, you need to look for the perfect placement ideas. You should never place the recliners against a wall, which is a general rule of thumb. Almost all recliners need some space to lean back without hitting the nearby furniture or wall. You can certainly put <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/recliners"><b>recliner sofas</b></a> in different places of the house. For instance, you can keep a recliner sofa with several sofa chairs and a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/coffee-tables"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><b><u>centre table</u></b></span></a> in the living room. Adding end tables make your recliner even more inviting; they can hold everything you need, like a book, a phone charger, a snack plate or a cold beverage.</p>
    <p>Recliners can also be kept alongside the bed in the bedroom if you want to rest while enjoying your book or binge-watching a web series. A PVC recliner sofa is resistant to almost all inorganic chemicals, and you can even place it on the balcony to enjoy the outside view. You can instantly transform your reclining couch by adding bright, colourful pillows and a throw. Adding a slipcover is another affordable strategy that can transform your recliner sofa from boring to memorable. Slipcovers come in various colour themes, and you will surely find the one that will complement the home d√©cor you have. </p>

  <h3>Points to consider while selecting the perfect sectional sofa</h3>
  <p>Sectional sofa is a space-efficient furniture piece that also creates an elegant environment in the room. It provides plenty of seating space to a family, and everyone gets a seat along with total comfort. Finding a perfect sectional sofa is also a big task and one of the most crucial investments you make for your home because they are expensive and need to last longer. While you can experiment with multiple designs, here are the four most important things you should consider when buying a sectional sofa.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Orientation</b>: While picking up the sectional sofa, you need to check the orientation. You can find LHS sectional sofa, RHS sectional sofa and corner sofas. LHS sectional sofas have a left-hand side configuration - that means they can be placed in a room where the door is on the right side. RHS sectional sofas are opposite as they are designed for rooms where the door is on the left. The corner sofas are designed for spacious rooms, and they usually come along with an open end where you can place the serving table. You can choose from 3 to 8 seater sectional sofas according to your space and requirement. Always measure your place with tape before buying a couch to determine the maximum sofa dimension that can fit well in your area. Also, pay attention to the height of the sofa, especially if your room has shelving or radiators.</li>
    <li><b>Select colours and designs according to the room</b>: You can place the sectional sofa in a living room, drawing room, study room and bedroom. Make sure the sofa you select goes well with the room's overall d√©cor theme and serves the purpose. You can pick big corner sofas for the living room that can offer a lot of seating space. Add beautiful lighting, a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/recliners"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><b><u>recliner</u></b></span></a> and a classic <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/coffee-tables"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><b><u>coffee table</u></b></span></a> to complete the look. For the study room, select an elegant and sleek sectional sofa in neutral colours. You can place a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/study-tables"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><b><u>study table</u></b></span></a> with a lovely table lamp and some motivational stickers to have a perfect ambience. Bedrooms look amazing with bucket sofas and a <span style="color: #1cb963;"><b>sectional couch</b></span> set near a window or a balcony. A sectional sofa always acts as a focal point in a room, and adding colours and patterns makes it more exciting.</li>
    <li><b>Invest in a sturdy frame</b>: A furniture frame plays a vital role in deciding strength and longevity. Hardwood frame is always a good option.

  <h3>Sofa come bed: a buying guide</h3>
  <p>A <b>sofa cum bed furniture</b> is a sofa that can be converted into a bed with an easy to pull out mechanism. Many people prefer the idea of getting a sofa cum bed instead of a traditional sofa. But before you choose one, ensure that you make the right choice. After all, buying a furniture piece is a long term investment, so getting the perfect option is important. To ease your selection task, we have curated certain factors that need to be considered before buying a sofa come bed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Measure up the available space</b>: Before you start searching for a <span style="color: #06b254;"><b>sofa cum bed</b></span>, measure up the space you have in your living room. Of course, you are getting it to utilize your space efficiently. So keep in mind the space required for placement and opening up the sofa cum bed. You must do the whole planning according to its placement; there should be enough space available on the front side so that you can easily pull the bed out. Also, check that it doesn‚Äôt give a cramped look to the room.</li>
    <li><b>Check the design and features</b>: Choose the style that will blend in well with the interior of your place at its best. You can place a <span style="color: #06b254;"><b>sofa come bed</b></span> in a living room, drawing room, study room or kid‚Äôs bedroom. Check the shape of your room and go for designs that upscale the interior of the room. For the study room, you can pick classic designs and neutral shades. For the living room or drawing room, select an eye-catching design according to the existing decor. Many <span style="color: #06b254;"><b>sofa cum bed latest design</b></span> options are multifunctional, and some offer additional seating while some provide you extra storage space. If your primary requirement is storage, then go for styles that have inbuilt storage boxes or storage drawers.</li>
    <li><b>Invest in a good frame and fabric</b>: Getting a lucrative deal doesn‚Äôt mean you should compromise quality. A frame of the furniture plays a vital role in deciding strength and longevity. Apart from frame quality, also check the fittings and fixtures inside. Inadequate padding and abrupt fittings can cause discomfort. Consider your usage and lifestyle while deciding on an upper fabric. Sensuous and glossy fabrics like silk, velvet, brocade are perfect for sophisticated spaces like drawing rooms. Whereas easy to clean fabrics, PVC or stain guarded twill are ideal for kid‚Äôs room. Also, look for options that have a manufacturer warranty. Nilkamal‚Äôs furniture provides a good return on investment due to the high-quality material and skilled craftsmanship.</li>

    <h3>Trendy steel wardrobes online for your home</h3>
    <p>There was a good reason that your grandparents and parents had steel almirah as their favourite storage unit for several years. With steel wardrobes, you can not only add a classic touch to your bedroom but also stack your essentials in one place. Nilkamal‚Äôs steel wardrobes are designed with multiple compartments, hanging rods and locker facility as well. Depending on your preference, consider the number of shelves, their placement and the locker availability. If you have clothes that only need to be hung, then choose designs with more hanging space. All you have to do is segregate and stash your belongings on various shelves and prevent unnecessary clutter in your room. These steel cupboards do not require heavy maintenance. You only need a damp cloth to clean and maintain your almirah for years. </p>
    <p>Explore the trendiest <b>double door steel almirah</b> online, including <b>steel almirah for home</b> and <b>office steel almirah</b>. You can also choose from a variety of <b>almirah with mirrors</b> and <b>almirah without mirrors</b>. With our entire range of products, you will indeed find something that goes well with your personality and lifestyle needs.</p>
    <h3>Top 6 benefits of buying steel wardrobes</h3>
    <p>There was a time when <b>steel almirah</b> was considered too utilitarian in style, but today there is a fresh surge in its popularity for various reasons. Here are the top 6 reasons to consider steel cabinets for your home.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is overwhelming scientific evidence that the steel has a non-porous surface so that no bacteria, liquids, moulds and fungus can penetrate it. This means they will get no place to hide. It also tolerates pest-fighting chemicals much better than wood due to its non-absorbent surface.</li>
      <li>Steel wardrobes have the perfect combination of form and function. The classic colours, matte or glossy finishing and the laminate drawer faces can transform a basic piece into something indistinguishable from the wooden furniture aesthetically. You can match them easily with your existing <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/office-furniture"><b><u>office furniture‚Äôs</u></b></a> colour and style schemes, such as with the <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/office-sofas"><b><u>office sofa</u></b></a> or <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/computer-tables"><b><u>computer table</u></b></a> and create a cohesive and fluid office decor. Colourful varieties can also go well in your living room with <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/plastic-chairs"><b><u>plastic chairs</u></b></a> and <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/dining-tables"><b><u>dining tables</u></b></a> sets, or in your bedroom beside your <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/double-size-beds"><b><u>double size bed</u></b></a>.</li>
      <li>Standard primary colour options or customised matching paints are relatively easy to achieve on steel since they do not show variations like wood graining.</li>
      <li>Steel shows a good level of heat resistance. It can sustain continuous heat exposure. There may be some discolouration with prolonged exposure to a high temperature, but it can take the heat.</li>
      <li>Steel almirah is quite durable. It can tolerate excessive use, making it perfect for group living environments such as hostels, dormitories, etc.</li>
      <li>While good quality steel wardrobes might have a higher price than their wooden equivalents, but you can expect steel wardrobes to last 10-15 years longer. It is a larger upfront investment, but the frequency of the replacement cycle is less. Nilkamal offers a domestic warranty on all steel wardrobes. We also provide replacement of any particular damaged part or entire product if that part is not available.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Different kinds of entertainment units</h3>

    <h3>How to choose the best ergonomic chair for the office?</h3>
    <p>Chairs can provide you with an excellent option to flex your creative muscles. While selecting a regular chair, you can experiment with multiple colours and designs. However, when <b>buying ergonomic office chairs online</b>, some critical criteria can help you choose the right one. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>The seat:</b> The seat is the place where you sit. There are two essential features related to the seat of the chair that is adjustable height and adjustable angle. In some chairs, you can adjust the height to match up the level of the table or the computer screen. This adjustability can avoid unnecessary pressure on the wrist or the back. Similarly, you can also adjust the seat to a specific angle that you may want for better comfort.</li>
      <li><b>The backrest:</b> The backrest provides support to the back and helps maintain a healthy sitting posture. Some chairs have a protrusion in the lower area that supports the lower back. In models, you can adjust the height of the backrest as well.</li>
      <li><b>The armrest for shoulder positioning:</b> The armrest is where you can rest your arms when you are not working on a mouse or a keyboard. Armrest usually has three critical features, adjustable width, adjustable height and removability. Other than this, some models come with padded armrests. Armrest padding is beneficial if you have pain in your elbow.</li>
      <li><b>Reclining feature:</b> Some <b>executive ergonomic chairs</b> are designed with reclining features. They have a tilt tension lock that lets you recline since you need to sit upright all the time without any relaxation, which can be strenuous to your back.</li>
      <li><b>The headrest:</b> The cushioned headrest is where you can put your head when you are in listening or watching mode. At this time, you may not have to extend your arms to the desk, and you can comfortably relax your head.</li>

    <h3>Wardrobes: A perfect storage solution</h3>
    <p>The bedroom is a very personal space, where you can relax and be at peace. A messy and cluttered room can never look pleasing. A wardrobe can help you organize your storage and accommodate useful articles all in one place. Although a wardrobe is majorly used for storing clothes, you can also keep beddings, electronics, cosmetics, books and accessories. Getting a spacious closet can help you get rid of additional storage furniture like smaller cabinets and a small chest of drawers that give your bedroom a clean and tidy look. You can set them up beside your bed, furnished with a comfortable <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/mattress"><b><u>mattress</u></b></a> by Nilkamal, to make your room even more cozy and neat. Nilkamal offers a premium range of wooden wardrobes that is a classic choice. They are timeless and long-lasting. The contemporary designs, rich wooden finishing and strong built can make them the best looking utility furniture in your house.</p>
    <p>Explore our range of <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/wardrobes"><span style="color: #33b050;"><b>modern wardrobes online</b></span></a>, including single door wardrobes, 2 door wardrobes, 3 door wardrobes, 4 door wardrobes with mirrors, sliding wardrobes, and bedroom wardrobes. You can also match your wardrobe to your <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/king-size-beds"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><b><u>king size bed</u></b></span></a>, <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/queen-size-beds"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><b><u>queen size bed</u></b></span></a> or bedside <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/chests-of-drawers"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><b><u>chest of drawers</u></b></span></a> to create a cohesive look. And if you are a bookworm, you can make your <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/book-cases-shelves"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><b><u>bookshelf design</u></b></span></a> the focal point of the room by adding a matching wardrobe. Our thoughtfully curated cupboard collection works for everyone in the family. Our range includes a wide choice of colours and materials to suit every mood and various sizes to suit every nook.</p>
    <h3>Additional benefits of having a wardrobe</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have a collection of garments for different occasions, keeping them together can ruin the folds and make them difficult to find. The wardrobe provides you ample space to segregate your garments. You can store work clothes, sleepwear, casuals and lingerie, all in different compartments.</li>
      <li>You don‚Äôt need a separate place to store beddings. These wardrobes are so spacious that you can easily keep quilts, blankets, pillows and bedsheets.</li>
      <li>Some wardrobes have grooming mirrors that can help you get ready, and you don‚Äôt have to buy a separate dresser. Moreover, the mirror also brightens up your space and make your room look larger.</li>
      <li>Since the wardrobes are bulky, they also elevate the overall look of the room. Just choose the right piece that goes well with your d√©cor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>All about different kinds of wardrobes</h3>
    <p>A wardrobe is the best way to add storage space to your living room or bedroom. Its colours, designs and finishing can also amp up the overall d√©cor of your space. Whether you match it to your bed, <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/bedside-tables"><b><u>bedside table</u></b></a>, or in your home office beside your <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/computer-tables"><b><u>computer table</u></b></a> and <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/wfh-chairs"><b><u>WFH chair</u></b></a>, you can choose one that blends in well with the rest of your decor.

  <h3>Factors to consider while picking up work from home chairs</h3>
  <p>Most of the work chairs are ergonomically designed. These chairs tend to be more comfortable as they ensure proper posture and offer the necessary support. While selecting a regular chair, you can experiment with multiple colours and designs, and chairs can provide you with an excellent option to flex your creative muscles. However, when selecting the chair for working, some essential criteria can help you choose the right chair.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The seat: The seat is the place where you sit. There are two critical features related to the chair's seat: adjustable height and adjustable angle. In some chairs, you can adjust the height to match up the level of the table or the computer screen. This adjustability can avoid unnecessary pressure on the wrist or the back. Similarly, you can also adjust the seat to a specific angle that you may want for better comfort.</li>
    <li>The backrest: The backrest provides support to the back and helps maintain a healthy sitting posture. Some chairs have a protrusion in the lower area that supports the lower back. In models, you can adjust the height of the backrest as well.</li>
    <li>The armrest for shoulder positioning: The armrest is where you can rest your arms when you are not working on a mouse or a keyboard. Armrest usually has three critical features: adjustable width, adjustable height and removability. Other than this, some models come with padded armrests. Armrest padding is beneficial if you have pain in your elbow. </li>
    <li>Reclining feature: Some WFH chairs are designed with reclining features. They have a tilt tension lock that lets you recline. Else, you would have had to sit upright all the time without any relaxation.</li>
    <li>The headrest: The cushioned headrest is where you can put your head when you are in listening or watching mode. At this time, you may not have to extend your arms to the desk, and you can comfortably relax your head.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We have covered almost all specific features of work from home chairs. Now you can make your choice according to your preference and requirements. </p>
